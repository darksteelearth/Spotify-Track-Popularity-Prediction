# HarvardX: PH125.9x Data Science Capstone - Spotify Track Popularity Prediction 

* Built a machine learning algorithm in R that accurately predicts the popularity of a Spotify track given its energy level and release year.
* Analyzed the accuracy of five different machine learning models, each incorporating energy level and release year as effects.
* Reached the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) using a random forest model.
